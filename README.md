# Welcome to We'llChat!

## Inspiration
Students lead hectic and often stressful lives and have to navigate a range of experiences that can be overwhelming to handle alone. It is important and a good practice to have someone to talk to, yet it is easy to become lost while finding the right person or professional. That's why we created We’llChat - a website app designed to connect students to people who truly care and professionals who are best suited to cater to their individual needs.

## What it does
Users will be able to interact with a chatbot, giving it information about their mental/physical wellbeing, what kind of help they would like and more. Using this info, the chatbot suggests professionals and similar people who they can save in their contacts to reach out to if they wish. In this way, if users want, they can reach out to people who have been in the same boat as them in terms of health struggles (providing a sense of community), and also connect with therapists, psychologists, etc for consultation.

## How we built it
The idea behind We’llChat was loosely based off of BuildSpace’s chatbot Sage, which connects individuals to others working on similar projects. We realized that many people lack quick access to reliable wellness resources, and though online sources and recommendations can be useful, it’s also important to get connected with people who are professionally trained to help you. That’s why we integrated both of these responses into our chatbot. We first made a rough figma file to visualize the color themes, fonts and the overall design, look and feel. We then built our frontend using HTML, CSS, React JS and Vite. The backend utilizes rag looking through a vectorDB of contacts to match the user with the most relevant people and help them as required.

## Challenges we ran into
We struggled with connecting the backend and the frontend together and make everything look seamless.
